# VersionGate

Self-hosted zero-downtime deployment engine. Push to GitHub → VersionGate pulls the source, builds a Docker image, spins up the new container, switches Nginx traffic, and tears down the old one — all without a single second of downtime.

Built for single-server (KVM/VPS) setups where you want Vercel-style deployments on your own hardware.

## What It Does

- **Blue-green deployments** — every project gets two container slots (blue/green). Deploys always target the idle slot; live traffic is never touched until the new container is confirmed healthy.
- **Webhook auto-deploy** — add your project's webhook URL to GitHub and every push to the configured branch triggers a deploy automatically.
- **One-click rollback** — restore the previous deployment instantly via the dashboard or API.
- **Crash recovery** — on restart, stale `DEPLOYING` records are marked `FAILED` and orphaned containers are cleaned up automatically.
- **AI CI pipeline generation** — generate a GitHub Actions workflow for any project with a single API call (requires Gemini API key).
